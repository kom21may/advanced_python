    "A class can have its own instance, but a module cannot be instantiated. We use the ‘class’ keyword to define a class, whereas to use modules, we use the ‘import’ keyword. We can inherit a particular class and modify it using inheritance. But while using modules, it is simply a code containing variables, functions, and classes."
